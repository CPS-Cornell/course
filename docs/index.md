# Welcome to Cyber-Physical Systems

## About

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a comprehensive course designed for students interested in the integration of computational and physical systems. It covers core concepts such as sensors, actuators, algorithms (such as communication protocols ,signal processing, computer vision, and feedback control) essential for modern systems like autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and robotics. Through hands-on labs,students will gain practical experience in programming microcontrollers (RaspberryPi Pico W), system integration, and problem-solving by implementing an autonomous robotic platform (Sparkfun XRP). The course emphasizes design trade-offs, systems architecture, and adaptability to new technologies, preparing students for careers in industries where CPS is increasingly critical. Whether you're a systems engineer, or someone passionate about integrating emergent technologies to solve real-world problems, this course equips you with the tools to tackle complex,interdisciplinary challenges in CPS.
