# Communication

## Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** 7-layer model is a conceptual framework used to understand how different networking protocols interact in a communication system. Each layer in the OSI model represents a specific function within the data communication process.

### The 7-Layer OSI Networking Hierarchy

1.  **Physical Layer**

    -   **Function**: The Physical layer is responsible for the physical connection between devices. It deals with the transmission and reception of raw binary data (bits) over a communication medium such as cables, fiber optics, or radio waves.

### Summary of OSI Layers

| **Layer**           | **Function**                                             | **Examples**                   |
|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **7. Application**  | Interface for end-user services and network apps         | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS           |
| **6. Presentation** | Data formatting, encryption, compression                 | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG, ASCII     |
| **5. Session**      | Manages sessions between applications                    | SMB, RPC, NetBIOS              |
| **4. Transport**    | Reliable data transfer, error handling, flow control     | TCP, UDP                       |
| **3. Network**      | Routing and forwarding of packets across networks        | IP, ICMP, routers              |
| **2. Data Link**    | Transfers frames between devices within the same network | Ethernet, MAC addresses, Wi-Fi |
| **1. Physical**     | Transmits raw data as electrical or radio signals        | Cables, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, hubs |

The OSI model serves as a theoretical framework. In practice, many protocols span multiple layers. For example, the **TCP/IP model**, commonly used in modern networking, combines some layers (e.g., Presentation and Application layers into one). Nonetheless, the OSI model is a useful way to understand how data moves through a network and how different protocols work together to ensure communication.

### OSI in Practice

The following example demonstrates how each layer of the **OSI model** is used when a user accesses a website via a browser. The data flows through each layer to ensure successful transmission and reception.

1.  **Physical Layer**

    -   **Function**: The Physical layer transmits raw binary data over the physical medium, such as Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi signals.

    -   **Example**: The network adapter (e.g., Ethernet port or Wi-Fi chip) on your computer sends electrical or radio signals representing bits across the network. The connection could be made through a cable or over a wireless network.

2.  **Data Link Layer**

    -   **Function**: The Data Link layer creates frames and handles error detection and correction for data transmitted within the local network.

    -   **Example**: Your computer’s MAC address is used to identify it on the local network. The router uses your MAC address to direct the request to the next point in the network. Data is encapsulated into Ethernet frames for transmission within the local area network (LAN).

3.  **Network Layer**

    -   **Function**: The Network layer manages IP addressing and routing, determining the best path for data to travel across different networks.

    -   **Example**: The router identifies your computer’s IP address and uses it to route your request to the web server hosting the website. The data is broken into packets and forwarded to the web server through the internet.

4.  **Transport Layer**

    -   **Function**: The Transport layer ensures reliable data transfer, error recovery, and flow control, splitting data into segments.

    -   **Example**: **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) breaks your HTTP request into segments and ensures that the segments are delivered in the correct order to the web server. It also handles retransmission if any segments are lost during transmission.

5.  **Session Layer**

    -   **Function**: The Session layer manages and maintains the communication session between the client (your browser) and the server.

    -   **Example**: When you open a connection to the web server (via HTTP), the session layer manages the communication session, ensuring that it stays open while you browse and closes it when you’re done.

6.  **Presentation Layer**

    -   **Function**: The Presentation layer translates data between the application and network formats, handling encryption and data formatting.

    -   **Example**: If the website uses **HTTPS**, SSL/TLS encryption is applied here, ensuring that sensitive information is encrypted before it is transmitted over the network. Data is also compressed or formatted for efficient transmission.

7.  **Application Layer**

    -   **Function**: The Application layer provides services directly to end-user applications, enabling interaction between applications and the network.

    -   **Example**: **HTTP** at the Application layer governs the exchange of web content. When you enter a URL, the browser sends an **HTTP GET request** to the web server. The server responds with HTML content, which your browser renders as a webpage.

**Explanation of the End-to-End Process** When a user enters a URL into a browser, the browser (Application layer) sends an HTTP request to the web server. The data is encrypted (Presentation layer), and the session is established (Session layer). The transport protocol (Transport layer) breaks the data into segments for transmission. The Network layer divides it into packets, which are encapsulated into frames (Data Link layer) and sent as signals (Physical layer). The server responds by reversing this process, ensuring successful communication.

## Fundamental Concepts in Wired Communication Protocols

1.  **Signal Transmission** (Analog vs. Digital)

    -   Data is transmitted through electrical signals.

    -   **Analog**: Continuous signal variation.

        -   Advantages

            -   Can represent a wider range of values, making it suitable for audio and video signals.

            -   Often simpler and more intuitive for real-world applications like voice transmission.

        -   Disadvantages

            -   More susceptible to noise and signal degradation over distance.

            -   Harder to process, store, and recover accurately compared to digital signals.

    -   **Digital**: Discrete voltage levels represent 1s and 0s.

        -   Advantages

            -   More resistant to noise, allowing for clearer signals over long distances.

            -   Easier to encrypt, compress, and correct errors in transmission.

            -   Allows for greater data processing and storage efficiency.

        -   Disadvantages

            -   Requires more bandwidth for the same amount of data compared to analog.

            -   Can be more complex and expensive to implement, especially in high-speed systems.

2.  **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication**

    -   **Synchronous**: Devices use a shared clock to synchronize data transfer (e.g., SPI).

        -   Faster, but requires clock lines.

    -   **Asynchronous**: No shared clock. Uses start/stop bits to mark data transmission (e.g., UART).

        -   More flexible but slower due to additional bits.

3.  **Baud Rate vs. Bit Rate**

    -   **Baud rate**: Number of signal changes (symbols) per second.

    -   **Bit rate**: Number of bits transmitted per second.

    -   May differ if complex encoding is used.

4.  **Duplexing** (Half-duplex vs. Full-duplex)

    -   **Half-duplex**: Data flows in both directions, but not simultaneously (e.g., RS-485).

    -   **Full-duplex**: Simultaneous bidirectional data flow (e.g., Ethernet, SPI with separate lines).

5.  **Bus Topology & Communication**

    -   Multiple devices share the same data lines.

    -   **Single-master** (e.g., I²C) vs. **multi-master** systems (e.g., CAN).

    -   Arbitration and bus contention are key in shared communication environments.

6.  **Addressing & Device Identification**

    -   Each device must have an address in shared communication systems.

    -   **Static** vs. **dynamic addressing**: Defines how devices are identified.

7.  **Error Detection & Correction**

    -   Errors are common in communication; systems must detect and correct them.

    -   Techniques include **parity bits**, **checksums**, and **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**.

    -   Ensures data integrity, especially in critical applications.

8.  **Electrical Characteristics** (Pull-up/Pull-down Resistors)

    -   **Pull-up/pull-down resistors** define logic levels when no active signal is present.

    -   Important in open-drain/open-collector configurations (e.g., I²C).

    -   Helps prevent floating pins and ensures signal stability.

    -   **Selecting Resistor Value**

        -   **Large Values**: reduce power consumption and noise sensitivity, but reduce rise time and reduce maximum communication speeds

        -   **Small Values**: increase rise time and communication speeds, but also increase power consumption and noise sensitivity

        -   Key considerations:

            -   Bus capacitance (affected by the length of the wires and number of devices)

            -   Desired clock speed

            -   Operating Voltage

9.  **Framing & Data Packets**

    -   Data is transmitted in structured frames or packets.

    -   Components include start/stop bits, headers, payloads, and error-check fields.

    -   Relevant in protocols like CAN and Ethernet for managing data streams and preventing collisions.

10. **Protocol Layering & Abstraction**

    -   Different communication protocols work at different layers of a system, with each layer adding additional functionality such as error correction, encryption, etc.

    -   Each layer is able to ignore all previous layers and assume the previously layers' functionality.

    -   Relates to the OSI model (e.g., Ethernet at the data link layer, TCP/IP at the network layer).

## Considerations for Reducing Electro-Magnetic Interference

1.  **Twisted Pair Cabling**

    -   **Why it helps**: Twisting the wires helps cancel out electromagnetic interference, as noise affects both wires equally, and the interference is neutralized when the signals are combined.

2.  **Shielded Cables**

    -   **Why it helps**: Shielding cables with a conductive layer (usually braided or foil) helps block external electromagnetic fields from penetrating and interfering with the signal.

3.  **Grounding**

    -   **Why it helps**: Proper grounding helps protect communication lines from voltage spikes, reduces the potential difference that can cause noise, and drains excess noise from the environment.

    -   **Key tips**: Ensure that the shield (if using shielded cables) is grounded at one end, and avoid ground loops, which can introduce noise instead of reducing it.

4.  **Cable Routing**

    -   **Why it helps**: Positioning communication cables away from sources of EMI (like power cables, motors, or high-frequency devices) minimizes the likelihood of noise induction.

    -   **Key tips**: Keep data cables as short as possible, and avoid running them parallel to power lines. If necessary, cross them at right angles to reduce exposure to magnetic fields.

5.  **Differential Signaling**

    -   **Why it helps**: Differential signaling transmits signals across two wires, with one wire carrying the inverse of the other. This reduces the impact of common-mode noise, as interference affects both wires equally and can be canceled out.

6.  **Use of Termination Resistors**

    -   **Why it helps**: Termination resistors at the ends of transmission lines (particularly for high-speed or long-distance communication) help prevent signal reflections, which can degrade signal quality and introduce noise.

7.  **Electrical Design**

    -   **Ferrite Beads**

        -   **Why it helps**: Ferrite beads act as low-pass filters, absorbing high-frequency noise from the communication lines and reducing EMI. They help suppress transient noise that may enter the circuit.

        -   **Use cases**: Commonly placed on power lines or data lines in sensitive systems like USB or Ethernet networks.

    -   **Capacitors**

        -   **Why it helps**: Placing decoupling capacitors across power and ground lines of communication components helps filter out high-frequency noise.

        -   **Key tips**: Use small-value capacitors (e.g., 0.1 µF) near communication ICs to filter noise from power supply lines.

### Summary of Key Considerations:

-   Twisted pair and shielded cables reduce EMI exposure.

-   Grounding and proper cable routing minimize noise and interference.

-   Differential signaling and termination resistors improve noise immunity and signal quality.

-   Ferrite beads and decoupling capacitors help filter high-frequency noise.

-   Slower signal transitions, lower frequencies, and good PCB design help in reducing EMI and ensuring reliable communication.

## Power Consumption Considerations for Wired Communication Protocols

### Static Power

Static power is the power consumed when a circuit is idle or in a steady-state condition. In communication protocols, static power primarily arises from:

#### Pull-up Resistors (in Open-Drain/Collector Architectures)

-   **What Happens?**

-   Many communication protocols, like I2C, use open-drain or open-collector outputs.

-   A pull-up resistor is used to pull the voltage line high when no device is actively driving it low.

-   Static power is consumed when the line is pulled **low**, creating a current path from the pull-up resistor to ground.

-   **Power Formula:**

    $$P_{static} = \frac{V^2}{R_{pullup}}$$

-   where:

    -   $V$: Bus voltage (e.g., 3.3V or 5V)

    -   $R_{pullup}$: Pull-up resistor value (e.g., 4.7 kΩ or 1 kΩ)

-   **Key Insights:**

    -   Static power is **proportional to the voltage** and **inversely proportional to the pull-up resistance**.

    -   Using smaller resistors increases static power but allows faster signal transitions.

    -   Example for I2C:

        $$P_{static} = \frac{3.3^2}{4700} ≈ 2.3 mW per line$$

#### Leakage Current

-   Leakage currents can occur in transistors and other components even when a device is in an idle or low-power state.

-   Though usually very small (nanoamps to microamps), they contribute to static power dissipation.

### Dynamic Power

Dynamic power is the power consumed during **switching activity**, when signals toggle between logic high and low. This is the dominant power component during active communication.

#### Charging and Discharging Capacitance

-   **What Happens?**

    -   Every time a signal transitions (rising or falling edge), the **bus capacitance** (wires, connectors, and device input pins) is charged or discharged.

    -   To transition a signal from low to high, current flows from the power supply to charge the capacitance.

    -   To transition from high to low, the stored charge flows to ground.

    -   This charge/discharge cycle consumes power.

-   **Power Formula:**

    $$ P_{dynamic} = f * C * V^2 $$

-   where:

    -   $f$: Signal frequency (transitions per second, e.g., 100 kHz for I2C standard mode)
    -   $C$: Effective capacitance of the bus (e.g., ~100 pF for I2C with small wiring)
    -   $V$: Voltage level of the bus (e.g., 3.3V or 5V)

-   **Key Insights:**

-   Dynamic power is **proportional to the square of the voltage**.

-   Increasing bus frequency or capacitance significantly increases power.

-   Example for I2C:

    $$ P_{dynamic} = 100 * 10^3 * 100 * 10^-12 * (3.3)^2 ≈ 0.11 mW $$

#### Short-Circuit Power

-   During switching, there’s a brief moment when both the pull-up and pull-down transistors of a CMOS driver are conducting simultaneously, creating a **short circuit** between the supply and ground.

-   This power dissipation is typically small but increases with higher operating frequencies.

### Static vs. Dynamic Power in Communication Protocols

| Aspect               | Static Power                                       | Dynamic Power                                |
|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Source               | Pull-up resistors, leakage currents                | Charging/discharging bus capacitance         |
| When Consumed        | Even when the bus is idle or steady                | Only during signal transitions (active bus)  |
| Dependent On         | Bus voltage, pull-up resistance                    | Frequency, bus capacitance, voltage level    |
| Formula              | \\P\_{static} = \frac{V^2}{R\_{pullup}}\\          | \\P\_{dynamic} = f \* C \* V^2A\\            |
| Reduction Strategies | Increase pull-up resistor value, lower bus voltage | Lower capacitance, reduce frequency, lower V |

### Practical Implications

1.  **At Low Speeds**:

    -   Static power dominates because the frequency of transitions is low.

    -   Example: I2C at 100 kHz primarily dissipates power through pull-up resistors.

2.  **At High Speeds**:

    -   Dynamic power dominates due to frequent charging/discharging of bus capacitance.

    -   Example: I2C at 3.4 MHz or SPI running at tens of MHz sees higher dynamic power dissipation.

3.  **Optimizing Power**:

    -   **Pull-up resistors**: Use the largest value that still satisfies signal rise-time requirements.

    -   **Bus capacitance**: Minimize trace lengths and device loads to reduce capacitance.

    -   **Voltage levels**: Use lower voltage levels (e.g., 1.8V instead of 3.3V or 5V).

### Broader Applicability

-   These principles are not unique to I2C; they apply to other communication protocols like **SPI**, **UART**, or **CAN bus**.

-   High-speed protocols like **PCIe** or **Ethernet** manage dynamic power by careful impedance matching and reducing load capacitance.

-   Static power concerns are increasingly relevant in ultra-low-power systems, where minimizing idle consumption is critical.

By understanding static and dynamic power, engineers can optimize communication protocols to balance speed, performance, and energy efficiency.

## Overview of Common Wired Communication Protocols

1.  **Ethernet**

    -   **Purpose:** Ethernet is the most widely used networking protocol for connecting devices in LANs, MANs, and industrial automation. It supports high-speed data transfer and internet communication.

## Hardware Support for Wired Communication Protocols

Most microcontrollers have hardware-level support for communication protocols like SPI, UART, and I2C. These protocols are typically implemented in hardware as dedicated peripheral modules, integrated into the microcontroller. Here’s a more detailed explanation:

1.  **Hardware-Level Support for Communication Protocols**

    -   Microcontrollers usually include dedicated hardware peripherals for common communication protocols:

    -   **SPI**: Microcontrollers have **SPI hardware modules** (often called **SPI peripherals**) that handle the clock generation, data shifting, and synchronization needed for SPI communication. This hardware support simplifies the communication process, offloading the low-level timing and data handling from the CPU.

    -   **UART**: **UART peripherals** are also very common in microcontrollers. The hardware handles generating start and stop bits, serializing data, adjusting baud rates, and detecting errors like parity errors. This greatly reduces the complexity of managing serial communication since software doesn’t need to manually manipulate bits and timing.

    -   **I2C**: Microcontrollers generally provide dedicated **I2C hardware modules** to handle clock generation, acknowledge bits, addressing, clock stretching, and data transfer. Hardware-level I2C support is particularly beneficial since I2C involves complex timing, addressing, and synchronization requirements that would be difficult to reliably manage in software alone.

2.  **Advantages of Hardware-Level Support**

    -   **Offloading Workload**: With hardware-level support, the **microcontroller’s CPU is freed** from managing the timing and low-level data manipulation required for communication, which allows it to focus on higher-level tasks.

    -   **Precise Timing**: The hardware peripherals generate the necessary **clock signals** for these protocols, ensuring precise timing that is difficult to achieve at the software level, especially with protocols like SPI and I2C that are sensitive to timing.

    -   **Reduced Latency**: Hardware peripherals operate independently of the CPU, which helps in achieving **lower latency** during data transmission and reception compared to a software-only implementation.

    -   **Reliability**: Hardware implementation is less prone to timing-related issues, which is crucial in synchronous protocols like SPI or I2C. Dedicated hardware modules ensure reliable clock synchronization and data integrity.

3.  **Software Implementation of Communication Protocols**

    -   In some cases, communication protocols can also be implemented entirely in software, known as **bit-banging**. However, this is less efficient compared to using hardware peripherals:

    -   **Bit-Banging**: In bit-banging, the microcontroller’s CPU directly controls GPIO pins to emulate the timing and signaling of a communication protocol. While this approach is flexible and can be used on any GPIO pins, it consumes considerable CPU resources and is prone to timing inaccuracies, especially for higher baud rates or complex protocols like I2C.

    -   **Use Cases**: Bit-banging is typically used when the microcontroller lacks hardware support for a particular protocol or when a greater number of communication channels are needed than the hardware peripherals can support. However, it is less common in production systems due to its drawbacks in terms of efficiency and reliability.

4.  **Hybrid Approach**

    -   Many microcontroller environments provide **hardware abstraction layers (HAL)** or **drivers** that allow developers to interact with the communication peripherals at a higher level using software. While the underlying data handling is still performed by hardware, software libraries or HALs provide an easier interface for configuring and controlling the peripherals.

### Summary

-   **Most microcontrollers** include **hardware peripherals** for protocols like **SPI**, **UART**, and **I2C**.

-   These hardware modules handle the low-level operations (clocking, timing, data serialization) required for the protocol, allowing for **efficient, reliable, and low-latency** communication.

-   **Software implementations** (bit-banging) are possible but are generally less efficient and used primarily when hardware support is not available or more channels are needed.

-   **Hardware-level support** provides numerous advantages in terms of **reliability, performance, and freeing CPU resources**, making it the preferred approach for implementing communication protocols in embedded systems.

## Wireless Communication Protocols

### Wireless Communication Overview

The choice of electromagnetic frequency band for wireless communication depends on the specific application, considering factors like range, data rate, and susceptibility to interference. Lower frequencies (below 1 GHz) are favored for long-range communication with low power consumption, while higher frequencies (like SHF and EHF) provide much faster data rates but are limited in range and line-of-sight. ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) bands are widely used for consumer electronics due to their unlicensed nature.

-   **Topology**: Supports star (infrastructure), peer-to-peer (ad-hoc), and mesh networks to cover a large area.

#### How Wi-Fi Works

1.  **Wireless Access Points (WAPs)**:

    -   A Wi-Fi network is typically created by a **wireless access point (AP)** or **router**, which transmits and receives data using radio waves.

    -   Devices (clients) like smartphones, laptops, and tablets communicate with the access point, which acts as a bridge to the wired network or the internet.

2.  **Radio Waves**:

    -   Wi-Fi operates on radio frequencies in the **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz** bands. Newer Wi-Fi versions, such as Wi-Fi 6E, also operate in the **6 GHz** band.

    -   The radio signal from the router can be picked up by any device within range that has a Wi-Fi adapter.

3.  **SSID (Service Set Identifier)**:

    -   Wi-Fi networks are identified by an **SSID**, which is the network name that devices use to connect to the access point.

    -   A user can select the SSID from a list of available networks and enter a password (if security is enabled) to connect.

4.  **Data Transmission**:

    -   Wi-Fi uses a modulation technique called **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)** to transmit data efficiently over different frequencies.

    -   Data is broken into smaller packets and transmitted wirelessly between devices and the access point.

5.  **Security**:

    -   Wi-Fi networks are secured using various encryption methods to protect the data being transmitted. Common security protocols include:

        -   **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**: Older and less secure.

        -   **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**: More secure than WEP but has been replaced by WPA2.

        -   **WPA2 and WPA3**: The current standard for securing Wi-Fi networks, with WPA3 offering the latest improvements in encryption and security.

#### Wi-Fi Standards

Wi-Fi operates under a family of IEEE 802.11 standards. The most common ones are:

-   **802.11b** (1999):

    -   Operates in the 2.4 GHz band.

    -   Maximum data rate: 11 Mbps.

#### Key Features of Wi-Fi

1.  **Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance** (CSMA/CA)

    -   CSMA/CA is a network protocol used in Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 standards) to manage how devices share the wireless medium and avoid collisions when transmitting data.

    -   In Wi-Fi, CSMA/CA prevents data collisions by having devices "listen" to the channel before transmitting.

    -   If the channel is busy, the device waits for a random backoff period before trying again.

    -   Once the channel is clear, the device transmits data, and the receiving device sends an acknowledgment (ACK) to confirm receipt.

    -   If no ACK is received, the data is retransmitted.

2.  **Multiple Input, Multiple Output** (MIMO)

    -   MIMO is a technology that uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to send and receive multiple data streams simultaneously.

    -   This increases the data throughput and improves signal reliability, especially in environments with obstacles or interference.

    -   MIMO is commonly used in Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n) and later standards.

3.  **Beamforming**

    -   Beamforming focuses the Wi-Fi signal in the direction of the connected device, rather than broadcasting it in all directions.

    -   This improves signal strength, range, and data rates by directing energy toward the device, reducing interference and enhancing overall performance.

    -   Beamforming is supported in Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax).

4.  **Mesh Networking**

    -   Mesh networking uses multiple access points (nodes) that work together to provide seamless Wi-Fi coverage across larger areas.

    -   In a mesh network, devices can automatically switch between nodes for the best connection, making it ideal for large homes, offices, or outdoor spaces.

    -   This reduces dead zones and enhances Wi-Fi performance.

5.  **Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access** (OFDMA)

    -   OFDMA is a Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) feature that divides the wireless channel into smaller subchannels, allowing multiple devices to share the same channel simultaneously.

    -   This improves efficiency, reduces latency, and optimizes performance in environments with many connected devices, such as offices or public hotspots.

#### Advantages of Wi-Fi
