# SYSEN 5410: Cyber-Physical Systems

## Course Info:
- **Course Title:** Cyber-Physical Systems
- **Author:** Jonathan Jaramillo
- **Revision Date:** 1/15/25
- **Credit Hours:** 4

## Course Overview:
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a comprehensive course designed for students interested in the integration of computational and physical systems. It covers core concepts such as sensors, actuators, communication protocols (e.g., I2C, SPI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), signal processing, computer vision, and control algorithms essential for modern systems like autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and robotics. 

Through hands-on labs, students will gain practical experience in programming microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi Pico W), system integration, and problem-solving by implementing an autonomous robotic platform (Sparkfun XRP). The course emphasizes design trade-offs, systems architecture, and adaptability to new technologies, preparing students for careers in industries where CPS is increasingly critical. Whether you're a systems engineer or someone passionate about integrating emergent technologies to solve real-world problems, this course equips you with the tools to tackle complex, interdisciplinary challenges in CPS.

- **When Offered:** Spring, on-campus
- **Prerequisites/Corequisites:** Familiarity with C++ and Python.

## Learning Outcomes:
1. Demonstrate proficiency and familiarity with a broad range of technologies used in cyber-physical systems.
2. Analyze complex cyber-physical systems and design subsystems, interfaces, and broader system architecture.
3. Analyze design trade-offs within a cyber-physical system to optimize system performance and meet end-user requirements.

## Textbooks and/or Required Materials:
The course will use a robotic lab kit for weekly labs. The lab kit consists of:
- XRP robot
- Proximity sensor
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Camera

**Cost:** $120 (students can keep the finished robot at the end of the course).

## Class Schedule:
- **Lectures:** Mon/Wed 8:40–9:55 in Hollister 206
- **Recitation:** Friday 9:05–9:55 in Snee 2152
- **Office Hours:** TBD

## Assignments, Attendance, Exams, and Projects:
- **Weekly Labs:** Take-home labs with reports are due weekly. Labs build towards a completed cyber-physical system by semester’s end. This year’s project is an autonomous robot capable of object detection, tracking, and navigation.
- **Attendance:** Attendance is mandatory for lectures and recitations. Pass/fail pop quizzes may be randomly assigned weekly to enforce attendance.
- **Case Studies:** 3–4 group case studies will be assigned throughout the semester.
- **Exams:** There are no prelims or finals. The course culminates in an open-ended final lab assignment integrating everything learned.

## Course Grading Scheme:
- **Labs:** 60%
- **Case Studies:** 30%
- **Participation:** 10%

## Topics Covered:
1. Cyber-physical system architectures and frameworks
2. Computational systems and computer architectures
3. Embedded systems and cloud computing platforms
4. Computer programming languages and paradigms
5. Wired and wireless communication protocols
6. Sensors and sensor networks
7. Actuators
8. Signal processing and computer vision

## Academic Integrity, AI, and Grading:
Students are expected to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity. Submitted work must represent the student’s own efforts. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are permitted for programming and writing assistance, but students are responsible for the quality of their submissions. Points may be deducted for low-quality or irrelevant AI-generated content in reports.
