This code tracks integral and derivative terms and handles capping output, integral wind-up, and checking whether the controller has reached its target (via <code>is_done</code>).</li> <li>How it works: The <code>update</code> method calculates a control output based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. You can configure gains (kp, ki, kd), output limits, and tolerance for stopping.</li> <li>Usage: Used anywhere you want closed-loop control for speeds, positions, or angles (for example, maintaining a certain heading or traveling at a certain velocity).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>motor.py</p> <ul> <li>What it contains: Two classes (<code>SinglePWMMotor</code> and <code>DualPWMMotor</code>) that manage basic motor operations such as setting direction, PWM duty cycle, and braking or coasting.</li> <li>How it works: Depending on the hardware version, the class sets a PWM signal to the motor driver pins, flipping direction if the effort is negative. There are also methods to brake or let the motor coast.</li> <li>Usage: These classes are lower-level drivers. Higher-level code (like <code>EncodedMotor</code> or <code>DifferentialDrive</code>) calls methods here to move the motors.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>encoder.py</p> <ul> <li>What it contains: An <code>Encoder</code> class that uses the Raspberry Pi Pico\u2019s Programmable I/O (PIO) to track shaft rotations. It reads two digital input signals (A and B channels) and keeps an internal count.</li> <li>How it works: The code uses a small assembly program (written in rp2 ASM) to decode the quadrature signals from the motor shaft. It returns both raw counts and derived revolutions.</li> <li>Usage: Provides feedback on how far (and in what direction) the motor or wheel has turned. Essential for measuring distance traveled and heading in a differential drive system.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>encoded_motor.py</p> <ul> <li>What it contains: An <code>EncodedMotor</code> class that combines a motor driver (from <code>motor.py</code>) and an encoder (from <code>encoder.py</code>). It has methods for speed control, effort control, and position resets.</li> <li>How it works:<ul> <li>When you call <code>set_speed</code>, it uses a PID controller (from <code>pid.py</code>) to match the measured speed (derived from the encoder) to the requested target.</li> <li>When you call <code>set_effort</code>, it directly sets PWM duty cycles.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Usage: Serves as a mid-level abstraction so you do not have to deal directly with PWM signals or raw encoder counts. Great for tasks like \u201cmaintain 10 cm/s\u201d or \u201capply half effort.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>differential_drive.py</p> <ul> <li>What it contains: A <code>DifferentialDrive</code> class that encapsulates two <code>EncodedMotor</code> objects (left and right) plus an optional IMU for heading measurements. It also has high-level movement methods (straight, turn, arcade drive).</li> <li>How it works:<ul> <li>Functions like <code>arcade</code> or <code>set_speed</code> combine efforts for left and right motors to move the robot forward, backward, or turn in place.</li> <li>The \u201cstraight\u201d and \u201cturn\u201d methods are asynchronous, using PID logic on distance or angle errors.</li> <li>Optionally uses IMU data (if present) to refine turning accuracy.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Usage: Instead of controlling each motor individually, you can just say: \u201cGo 20 cm forward\u201d or \u201cTurn 90 degrees,\u201d and it handles the details via motor and encoder data.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>imu.py</p> <ul> <li>What it contains: An <code>IMU</code> class to read accelerometer and gyroscope data from an onboard LSM6DSO sensor. It includes methods to calibrate the sensor, get X/Y/Z rates, and keep an internal running pitch/roll/yaw.</li> <li>How it works:<ul> <li>Uses I2C to communicate with the sensor.</li> <li>On a timer interrupt, it continuously updates angles (pitch, roll, yaw) based on the gyro\u2019s rotation rates.</li> <li>Allows calibrations for offsets so you can zero out drift on each axis.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Usage: Provides orientation information that can be fused with encoder data. In the lab, this is the \u201csensor measurement\u201d side of the Kalman filter.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>imu_defs.py</p> <ul> <li>What it contains: Constants and register definitions used by <code>imu.py</code>. For instance, the sensor\u2019s I2C address and bitfield definitions for scale ranges (2g, 4g, etc.), output data rates, and so on.</li> <li>How it works: <code>imu.py</code> uses these definitions to set up the IMU registers (e.g., to pick a measurement rate of 208 Hz and a gyro range of \u00b12000 dps).</li> <li>Usage: You likely will not need to modify this file unless you want to change register-level behavior.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>udp_server.py</p> <ul> <li>What it contains: A simple <code>UDPServer</code> class and a helper function <code>connect_to_wifi</code>. The class handles sending strings or bytes to a specified IP/port.</li> <li>How it works:<ul> <li>Uses a standard Python socket on the Pico to transmit data via UDP.</li> <li><code>connect_to_wifi(ssid, password)</code> brings up the network interface and attempts to join the WiFi network.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Usage: In <code>kalman_filter.py</code>, you create a <code>UDPServer</code> instance and call <code>send</code> to pass data back to a client on your laptop (for plotting or logging).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>kalman_filter.py</p> <ul> <li>What it contains:<ul> <li>A main loop (using <code>asyncio</code>) that continuously reads encoder yaw (from the differential drive) and gyro yaw (from the IMU) and fuses them using a simple 1D Kalman filter.</li> <li>Parameters for the filter (Q, R, P) and an example of how to store readings in arrays.</li> <li>A routine to send the data arrays to a laptop via UDP once the array is filled.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How it works:<ul> <li>Defines <code>Q</code> (process noise), <code>R</code> (measurement noise), and <code>P</code> (initial covariance).</li> <li>Each iteration does a predict-and-update step to estimate heading.</li> <li>Collects data in arrays (<code>time_data</code>, <code>encoder_yaw_data</code>, <code>imu_yaw_data</code>, <code>kalman_data</code>, etc.) and sends them via <code>udp_server.send()</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Usage: This is the main script you run on the Pico. You can alter Q, R, or the array sizes and observe the results in real time.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>timeout.py</p> <ul> <li>What it contains: A <code>Timeout</code> class that helps track elapsed time and can indicate when a specified duration has passed.</li> <li>How it works: When initialized with a timeout value in seconds, it records the current time (in milliseconds) and later checks whether the difference exceeds that timeout. If it does, <code>is_done()</code> returns True.</li> <li>Usage: Primarily used to enforce a maximum duration for certain tasks (for instance, in <code>differential_drive.py</code> to stop trying to move forward or turn if it takes too long). This ensures the robot doesn\u2019t stall indefinitely.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"labs/Lab5/Lab5/#files-designed-to-run-on-the-laptop-client","title":"Files Designed to Run on the Laptop Client","text":"<p>The following files are not intended for the Pico.

A graduate student has trouble keeping their house plant a live so they design a water system with the following features: A soil moisture sensor is placed in the pot and is connected to a Raspberry pi via I2C.

To water the plant, the Raspberry pi generates a digital signal that engages a motor driver, turning on a stepper motor driven water pump. The Raspberry pi is connected via wifi to a the internet, and uses HTTPS to determine the user-defined moisture level threshold.

It is a complex instruction that combines repetition and memory manipulation into a single instruction.</p> </li> <li> <p>How It Works: This instruction repeats the <code>MOVS</code> operation (which moves data from one memory location to another) multiple times, as specified by the value in the <code>CX</code> (or <code>ECX</code> for 32-bit, <code>RCX</code> for 64-bit) register.

RISC architectures prioritize simplicity and efficiency, so copying a block of memory would require a loop with multiple instructions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A load instruction to load the data from memory,</p> </li> <li> <p>A store instruction to write the data to the new location,</p> </li> <li> <p>A branch or loop instruction to repeat the process.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For example, in ARM or RISC-V, you might write a loop to manually copy memory, which breaks the task into smaller, simpler instructions.</p> <p>x86 Example:</p> <pre><code>MOV RCX, 100      ; Move 100 (number of elements) into RCX\nMOV RSI, source   ; Load source address into RSI\nMOV RDI, dest     ; Load destination address into RDI\nREP MOVSB         ; Copy 100 bytes from source to destination\n</code></pre> <p>RISC Equivalent Example (ARM Pseudocode):</p> <pre><code>MOV R0, source      ; Load source address\nMOV R1, dest        ; Load destination address\nMOV R2, #100        ; Set loop counter (100 bytes)\n\nloop:\n    LDRB R3, [R0], #1   ; Load byte from source, increment source pointer\n    STRB R3, [R1], #1   ; Store byte to destination, increment destination pointer\n    SUBS R2, R2, #1     ; Decrement counter\n    BNE loop            ; If counter not zero, repeat loop\n</code></pre> <p>In this comparison, the x86 CISC instruction <code>REP MOVS</code> is a single instruction that handles looping, moving, and incrementing, whereas in RISC, the same operation requires multiple instructions, each performing a single task. So why use RISC? What advantage is there to using a microarchitecture and ISA that requires more assembly code? RISC architectures offer simplicity, speed, and power efficiency by using a small set of simple instructions that typically execute in a single clock cycle. This leads to faster instruction throughput, efficient pipelining, and lower power consumption, making RISC ideal for mobile, embedded, and energy-sensitive applications. However, because RISC requires more instructions to perform complex tasks, it may result in larger programs and more memory usage. CISC, on the other hand, uses more complex instructions, allowing each instruction to accomplish multiple tasks. This can reduce the number of instructions needed, improving memory efficiency and simplifying low-level programming. However, CISC processors are typically more complex, slower in terms of individual instruction execution, and may consume more power, which can be a disadvantage in energy-sensitive devices.</p> <p>Different processors implement different instruction sets, which can affect the performance, efficiency, and capabilities of a system.</p>"},{"location":"notes/Module2/#common-instruction-set-architectures-isas","title":"Common Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs)","text":"<ol> <li> <p>x86 Instruction Set</p> <ul> <li> <p>Type: CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)</p> </li> <li> <p>History: The x86 architecture was originally developed by Intel in 1978 for their 16-bit microprocessor and has since evolved into the most widely used ISA for desktop, laptop, and server processors.

You simply select the correct COM port or USB port from the Tools menu.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Writing Code in the Arduino Language (Based on C/C++)</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of C++ known as the Arduino language, which abstracts much of the complexity involved in microcontroller programming. The code is organized around two main functions:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>setup()</code>: Runs once when the microcontroller starts and is used for initialization (e.g., setting up pin modes, initializing libraries, and starting serial communication).</p> </li> <li> <p><code>loop()</code>: This function contains the main logic of your program and runs continuously after <code>setup()</code> is complete.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Example of a simple Arduino sketch:</p> <p>void setup() {   pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);  // Initialize the built-in LED pin as an output }</p> <p>void loop() {   digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // Turn the LED on   delay(1000);                      // Wait for 1 second   digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // Turn the LED off   delay(1000);                      // Wait for 1 second }</p> </li> <li> <p>This example blinks the built-in LED on and off, using simple high-level functions like <code>digitalWrite()</code> and <code>delay()</code> to control the hardware.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Using Libraries</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Arduino IDE offers a wide array of libraries to simplify working with hardware peripherals (e.g., sensors, communication modules, displays). You can easily install libraries through the Library Manager:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Built-in libraries: The IDE comes with many built-in libraries for common peripherals like I2C, SPI, UART, servo control, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Third-party libraries: Additional libraries can be installed via the Library Manager for more advanced functionality, such as controlling displays (e.g., OLED or LCD), working with sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity), or adding network capabilities (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth).</p> </li> <li> <p>The libraries handle most of the low-level hardware details, allowing users to interact with hardware using high-level commands.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Uploading the Program to the Microcontroller</p> <ul> <li> <p>Once the code is written, you can upload the sketch to the microcontroller by clicking the Upload button in the IDE. The process is simple:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The IDE compiles the code using avr-gcc (for AVR-based boards) or arm-gcc (for ARM-based boards).</p> </li> <li> <p>It then uploads the compiled binary to the microcontroller via a bootloader, using the selected port.</p> </li> <li> <p>After the upload, the program starts running immediately on the microcontroller.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Debugging Using the Serial Monitor</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Arduino IDE does not provide advanced debugging tools like breakpoints or watchpoints. Instead, it relies heavily on Serial Monitor for basic debugging:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You can use <code>Serial.begin()</code> in <code>setup()</code> to initialize serial communication and <code>Serial.print()</code> or <code>Serial.println()</code> to print messages or variable values to the serial monitor.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Serial Monitor allows you to see output from the microcontroller in real time and can also be used to send data back to the microcontroller during runtime.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Code Portability and Multiple Boards Support</p> <ul> <li> <p>One of the strengths of the Arduino IDE is the ability to write code that is portable across different microcontroller boards with minimal changes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Core Abstraction: Arduino abstracts much of the hardware-specific details into cores, allowing the same code to run on different boards. For example, code written for the Arduino Uno (AVR-based) can often be uploaded to an ESP32 or Arduino Nano with little modification.</p> </li> <li> <p>Board Manager: By installing additional cores via the Board Manager, you can expand support for third-party boards like ESP8266, ESP32, and others.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Limitations and Advanced Features</p> <ul> <li> <p>While the Arduino IDE is excellent for ease of use and rapid development, it has limitations compared to manufacturer development tools:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Limited debugging: No hardware-level debugging features (like breakpoints or step-by-step execution) without additional tools.</p> </li> <li> <p>Limited optimization: The libraries provided by Arduino are generic and may not be highly optimized for performance or memory usage, which could be a limitation in resource-constrained systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Abstraction overhead: The simplicity provided by Arduino\u2019s libraries means that direct hardware control and fine-tuned performance optimizations may not be easily achievable without diving into lower-level code.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"notes/Module2/#summary_2","title":"Summary","text":"<p>The Arduino IDE simplifies the process of programming a microcontroller, making it ideal for beginners, hobbyists, and those working on rapid prototypes.

These protocols are typically implemented in hardware as dedicated peripheral modules, integrated into the microcontroller. Here\u2019s a more detailed explanation:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Hardware-Level Support for Communication Protocols</p> <ul> <li> <p>Microcontrollers usually include dedicated hardware peripherals for common communication protocols:</p> </li> <li> <p>SPI: Microcontrollers have SPI hardware modules (often called SPI peripherals) that handle the clock generation, data shifting, and synchronization needed for SPI communication. This hardware support simplifies the communication process, offloading the low-level timing and data handling from the CPU.</p> </li> <li> <p>UART: UART peripherals are also very common in microcontrollers. The hardware handles generating start and stop bits, serializing data, adjusting baud rates, and detecting errors like parity errors. This greatly reduces the complexity of managing serial communication since software doesn\u2019t need to manually manipulate bits and timing.</p> </li> <li> <p>I2C: Microcontrollers generally provide dedicated I2C hardware modules to handle clock generation, acknowledge bits, addressing, clock stretching, and data transfer. Hardware-level I2C support is particularly beneficial since I2C involves complex timing, addressing, and synchronization requirements that would be difficult to reliably manage in software alone.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Advantages of Hardware-Level Support</p> <ul> <li> <p>Offloading Workload: With hardware-level support, the microcontroller\u2019s CPU is freed from managing the timing and low-level data manipulation required for communication, which allows it to focus on higher-level tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Precise Timing: The hardware peripherals generate the necessary clock signals for these protocols, ensuring precise timing that is difficult to achieve at the software level, especially with protocols like SPI and I2C that are sensitive to timing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reduced Latency: Hardware peripherals operate independently of the CPU, which helps in achieving lower latency during data transmission and reception compared to a software-only implementation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reliability: Hardware implementation is less prone to timing-related issues, which is crucial in synchronous protocols like SPI or I2C.

While this approach is flexible and can be used on any GPIO pins, it consumes considerable CPU resources and is prone to timing inaccuracies, especially for higher baud rates or complex protocols like I2C.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use Cases: Bit-banging is typically used when the microcontroller lacks hardware support for a particular protocol or when a greater number of communication channels are needed than the hardware peripherals can support. However, it is less common in production systems due to its drawbacks in terms of efficiency and reliability.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Hybrid Approach</p> <ul> <li>Many microcontroller environments provide hardware abstraction layers (HAL) or drivers that allow developers to interact with the communication peripherals at a higher level using software.

In DC motors, it often contains permanent magnets, while in AC motors, it consists of coils that generate a rotating magnetic field when energized.</p> <p>Rotor The rotating component within the stator, responsible for producing motion. The rotor is influenced by the stator\u2019s magnetic field and converts electrical energy into mechanical rotation. In DC motors, it is connected to a commutator.</p> <p>Windings Coils of wire that create magnetic fields when electric current flows through them. Windings are often found on both the stator (in AC motors) and the rotor (in DC motors). Their arrangement impacts the motor\u2019s speed, torque, and efficiency.</p> <p>Armature This is the core component, typically the rotating part in a DC motor, where the interaction of magnetic fields generates torque. The armature holds the windings and is responsible for converting electrical energy into mechanical motion.</p> <p>Commutator (in brushed DC motors) A segmented ring attached to the rotor. It periodically reverses the current direction in the windings to sustain unidirectional rotation. The commutator works with brushes to maintain electrical contact.</p> <p>Brushes (in brushed DC motors) Conductive carbon or metal pieces that maintain contact with the commutator. Brushes enable the current to flow into the rotor\u2019s windings, creating the necessary magnetic field for rotation.</p> <p>Shaft A central metal rod connected to the rotor, which transfers the motor\u2019s mechanical energy to external systems. The shaft spins with the rotor and drives attached components like gears or pulleys.</p> <p>Bearings Mechanical supports for the shaft, allowing it to rotate smoothly within the motor housing. Bearings reduce friction and wear, enhancing motor efficiency and lifespan.</p> <p>Motor Housing (or Frame) The outer casing that supports and protects the motor\u2019s internal components. It helps with heat dissipation and prevents dust, debris, and other contaminants from entering the motor.</p> <p>Torque Constant (Kt) The torque constant defines the relationship between the input current and the resulting torque in a motor. It is typically measured in Newton-meters per ampere (Nm/A). A higher torque constant indicates that the motor generates more torque for a given current.</p> <p>Speed Regulation Constant The speed regulation constant describes how well a motor maintains its speed under varying loads. It is usually given as a percentage and represents the change in speed from no load to full load.Lower speed regulation indicates better stability, meaning the motor can maintain a consistent speed despite changes in load.</p> <p>Back EMF The voltage generated by an electric motor as it rotates, opposing the applied input voltage. This phenomenon occurs due to Faraday\u2019s Law of Induction: as the motor\u2019s armature (or rotor) spins within a magnetic field, it induces a voltage in the opposite direction of the supply voltage.</p> <p>Power Factor In AC motors. The ratio of real power (used for work) to apparent power (total power drawn from the source). It indicates how effectively the motor converts electrical power into useful work. A power factor closer to 1 (or 100%) means higher efficiency, with less wasted energy in the form of reactive power.</p> <p>Slip In an AC motor. The difference between the synchronous speed (the speed of the magnetic field) and the actual rotor speed, expressed as a percentage. Slip allows torque production in induction motors, as it creates relative motion between the magnetic field and rotor. Without slip, an induction motor would not generate torque.</p>"},{"location":"notes/Module7/#dc-motor-characteristic","title":"DC Motor Characteristic","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Torque vs. Speed</p> <ul> <li> <p>No-load Speed: At zero torque (no load), the motor runs at its maximum speed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stall Torque: At zero speed, the motor produces its maximum torque (stall torque).</p> </li> <li> <p>Equation:</p> \\[T = T_{\\text{stall}} \\left(1 -

The default <code>:8888</code> means it will serve an HTML page with the player.</li> <li><code>paths</code>: This is a dictionary where each key is a unique stream path (e.g., <code>cam</code>).</li> <li><code>source: rpiCamera</code>: Tells MediaMTX to use a Raspberry Pi camera as the source.</li> <li><code>rpiCameraRaspiStill: false</code>: Crucial for modern Raspberry Pi OS. This directs MediaMTX to use the <code>libcamera</code> framework. If this was <code>true</code>, it would try to use the older <code>raspivid</code> which is deprecated.</li> <li><code>rpiCameraWidth</code>, <code>rpiCameraHeight</code>, <code>rpiCameraFps</code>: Adjust these for your desired balance of quality, performance, and latency. The Pi Zero 2 W can handle 720p at 15-30fps for streaming, but lower resolutions like 640x480 might yield even lower latency if acceptable.</li> <li><code>rpiCameraHFlip</code>, <code>rpiCameraVFlip</code>: Set to <code>true</code> if your camera image is upside down or mirrored.</li> <li><code>rpiCameraBitrate</code>: Controls the video quality and bandwidth usage. Lower can mean lower latency but also lower quality.</li> <li><code>rpiCameraAfMode</code>, <code>rpiCameraLensPosition</code>: Relevant if you have a Camera Module 3 or other autofocus-capable module.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Save the file and exit nano: <code>Ctrl+X</code>, then <code>Y</code>, then <code>Enter</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>5. Run MediaMTX:</p> <p>Navigate to the directory where you extracted MediaMTX and run it:</p> <pre><code>./mediamtx\n</code></pre> <p>You should see log output in your terminal indicating that MediaMTX has started, that it's listening on various ports (including HTTP/WebRTC, typically 8888, and RTSP, typically 8554 if enabled), and that it's trying to access your camera.</p> <p>Look for lines like:</p> <pre><code>INF MediaMTX vX.Y.Z\nINF [path cam] [rpiCamera] opened\nINF [WebRTC] listener opened on :8888 (HTTP)\nINF [RTSP] listener opened on :8554 (TCP) (if RTSP is enabled for the path or globally)\n</code></pre> <p>If you see errors related to the camera, double-check your <code>mediamtx.yml</code> configuration, camera connection, and <code>libcamera</code> functionality.</p> <p>6. Access the WebRTC Stream on Your Laptop:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Find your Raspberry Pi's IP address:     On the Pi, run:</p> <pre><code>hostname -I\n</code></pre> <p>This will show you the IP address (e.g., <code>192.168.1.10</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Open a web browser on your laptop:     Use a modern browser that supports WebRTC (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).</p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to the WebRTC stream URL:     The URL will be <code>http://&lt;YOUR_RASPBERRY_PI_IP&gt;:8888/cam</code>     (Replace <code>&lt;YOUR_RASPBERRY_PI_IP&gt;</code> with the actual IP address and <code>cam</code> with the path name you used in <code>mediamtx.yml</code>).</p> <p>You should see a simple web page with a video player, and after a brief moment, your Raspberry Pi's camera stream should appear with low latency.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorials/webrtc_tutorial/#medianmtx-service-optional","title":"MedianMTX Service (Optional)","text":"<p>Running MediaMTX directly in the terminal means it will stop when you close the terminal or SSH session.

The Pi Zero 2 W's Wi-Fi can be a bottleneck. If latency is an issue, try moving closer to your router or using a less congested Wi-Fi channel. A wired USB Ethernet adapter can significantly improve stability and reduce latency.</li> <li>Resolution/FPS/Bitrate: If latency is still too high, try reducing <code>rpiCameraWidth</code>, <code>rpiCameraHeight</code>, or <code>rpiCameraFps</code> in <code>mediamtx.yml</code>. A lower bitrate can also help but will reduce quality.</li> <li>CPU Load: Use <code>htop</code> on the Pi to monitor CPU usage. If it's consistently very high (e.g., &gt;80-90% across cores), the Pi might be struggling. This usually means hardware encoding isn't working correctly or the settings are too demanding. MediaMTX using <code>libcamera</code> should leverage hardware H.264 encoding.</li> <li>Client-Side: Ensure your laptop isn't overloaded, and the browser is up to date.</li> <li>Firewall: If you're using a firewall on your Raspberry Pi or laptop, ensure port <code>8888</code> (or your configured WebRTC port) and any ports used for WebRTC data channels (usually a dynamic range over UDP) are allowed. For local networks, this is typically not an issue unless you have custom firewall rules.</li> <li>MediaMTX Logs: The output from <code>./mediamtx</code> (or <code>journalctl -u mediamtx -f</code> if running as a service) is invaluable for diagnosing issues.</li> </ul> <p>This detailed guide should help you get WebRTC streaming up and running with MediaMTX on your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Remember that achieving sub-300ms consistently depends on optimizing all parts of the chain, especially the network and encoding settings.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/zero_tutorial/","title":"Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W: Setup and Usage Guide","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/zero_tutorial/#1-overview-and-prerequisites","title":"1.
